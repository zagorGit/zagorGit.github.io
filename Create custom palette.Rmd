If you are not satisfied with the default configuration, you need to choose three colours from which custom palette will be created.

* Select lower boundary colour (e.g. lowest logFC)
* Select intermediate colour
* Select upper boundary colour (e.g. highest logFC)

Also selected upper/lower boundary palette threshold - to define the extreme value palette cut-off, 
meaning that the nodes that have higher/lower values than the boundary will be coloured in higher/lower boundary colour.

Generated palette can be viewed in the TAB <a href="DE_palette.html">DE palette</a>.

<div class="ui-block-a">Click on the button <button><b><font color='green'>Proceed</font></b></button> when you are satisfied with your selection.</div>

Now you can examine your experimental data in the context of a prior knowledge network.
