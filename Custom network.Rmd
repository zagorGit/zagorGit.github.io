For DiNAR to work appropriately, Custom Network (CN) should have the same format as the LKNs.

The first prerequisite are the clusters of appropriate size for visualisation.

Second, non-overlapping two-dimensional coordinates/layout for corresponding nodes must be provided.

In the case CN is selected, one needs to upload:

* table containing nodes/genes information

* table containing edges/reactions information

</br>

</br>

</br>

</br>
The files should be in the tab-separated format with the following column names (header):

</br>  

* nodes file

    geneID - containing node IDs /gene identifiers

Additional columns between first and the last one are possible, but will be ignored in DiNAR analysis.
