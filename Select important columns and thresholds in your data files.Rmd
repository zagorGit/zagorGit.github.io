1. Select column (name) with gene IDs (e.g. geneID).</br>
2. Select column (name) with outcome of statistical test (e.g. adj.P.Val).</br>
3. Type in desired threshold to filter nodes based on the statistical test. (e.g. 0.01)</br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the nodes that have value higher of the threshold defined will not be shown in the DiNAR analyses.</br>
4. Select column (name) with measure of response (change in expression value, e.g. logFC).</br>
5. Type in cut-off threshold (absolute value) for minimal desired intensity of response. (e.g. 0.8)</br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the nodes that have value in the defined closed interval will not be shown in the DiNAR analyses (e.g. -0.8 < logFC < 0.8).</br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other nodes that meet the criteria will be coloured and scaled according to the values in previously defined column.

</br>
In the case that some column names contain ID, adj.p.val or logFC, they will be proposed automatically.<br>
